## Codespaces

- Does not support mounting in the same way as locally as ${localEnv:HOME} maps to /

## Local

- Supports mounting useful directories, and ensuring host CA's are installed in the devcontainer

## Future changes

- The devcontainer spec for extends will stop the need for duplication https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/issues/22
